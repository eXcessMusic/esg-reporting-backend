# 🌍 Emissions Tracking API

## Welcome to the Emissions Tracking API Project! 🌱

This project is an emissions tracking API developed as part of a job application for an ESG Reporting company. It's designed to help organizations monitor and manage their greenhouse gas emissions effectively. Because let's face it, the only thing we want warming up is our coffee, not our planet! ☕🌡️

## Project Overview 🚀

This API provides a robust set of tools for:

- 📊 Tracking emissions from multiple sources over time
- 🎯 Creating and managing reduction strategies with multiple modifications
- 🔧 Applying both simple and progressive modifications to emission sources
- 🔮 Projecting future emissions based on current data and applied modifications
- 🧮 Calculating total emissions and reductions for specific time periods

This app's goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for businesses looking to understand and reduce their environmental impact. Think of it as a fitness tracker, but for your company's carbon footprint!

## Technology Stack 💻

- Python 3.x (Powered by snakes, not emissions 🐍)
- Django v5.1
- Django REST Framework v3.15
- PostgreSQL for robust data storage
- NumPy for efficient calculations

## API Documentation 📚

For a detailed overview of all the cool tricks this API can do, check out the [API_DOCUMENTATION.md](API_DOCUMENTATION.md) file. I promise it will be worth the read!

## Running Tests 🧪

To make sure everything's working as expected (because we take climate change seriously, even if we don't always take ourselves seriously):

```
python manage.py test emissions
```

## Key Features and Improvements 🚀

- 🔗 Implemented hyperlinked serializers for improved API navigation
- 🔄 Set up a flexible system to easily switch between local and Docker database configurations
- 🖥️ Created a basic frontend dashboard template for potential future UI integration
- 📊 Implemented progressive modifications for more nuanced emission reduction strategies
- 🔢 Developed support for multiple reduction strategies per report
- 🧮 Optimized calculations using NumPy for improved performance
- 🔍 Improved query efficiency to reduce database load
- 🔄 Implemented caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- 💰 Utilized Decimal for financial calculations to ensure precision
- 🚀 Implemented vectorized operations for projecting emissions and calculating reductions
- ✅ Enhanced input validation for API endpoints to improve data integrity

## Potential Future Enhancements
- <s>📈 Implement data visualization tools to graphically represent emission trends and projections</s> Done 🎉
- 🔐 Add user authentication and authorization for secure multi-tenant usage
- 🔔 Implement a notification system for when emissions exceed certain thresholds
- 🤖 Integrate machine learning algorithms for predictive emission analysis

## Project Context 🖼️

This project was developed as part of a job application for an ESG reporting company. While it's not an open-source project, it demonstrates my approach to solving real-world problems in the environmental sector using modern web technologies, and my ability to learn new business logic quickly and efficiently!

## Closing Thoughts 💭

Thank you for taking the time to review this project. I hope it showcases both my technical skills and my passion for creating tools that can make a positive impact on the environment. It also allowed me to widen my knowledge in the technical aspects of crucial reporting for ecology, and I'm already looking forward to diving deeper into this!

I'm excited about the possibility of bringing this kind of innovation to your projects.
And I hope by now you are as well 👀
